Started internship at The Spark Foundation in Sept 2020. This repository contains all the tasks completed for the internship

# Task #2: Explore To  Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

# Task #3: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning
From the given dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
